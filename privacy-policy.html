                    operate and maintain our services. These third-parties service providers act as our processors for
                    the purposes outlined in the table in ap. 4 above. Rest assured that when engaging these third
                    parties, appropriate contractual agreements (Data Processing Agreements) compliant with the GDPR
                    requirements are put in place between us and the third-party provider:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>With our business partners (for example, this could include our partners from whom you or your
                        company or your organisation purchased our Products. Personal Data will only be transferred to a
                        business partner who is contractually obliged to comply with SBFE data protection standards and

                        Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement and as expressly instructed by SBFE;</li>
                </ol>

                <p>iii. If we are legally required to disclose your Personal Data, for example, to comply with any legal
                    obligation (including, without limitation, to comply with tax reporting requirements and disclosures
                    to regulators), or to establish, exercise or defend legal rights, described in the table in ap. 4

                    Group for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes. As we continue to
                    develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets, subsidiaries or business units. In such
                    transactions, your Personal Data generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains
                    subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice or Statement (unless, of course, you
                    consent otherwise).</p>

                    of
                    the due diligence process and will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets.

                        href="mailto:GDPR.info@suntory.com">GDPR.info@suntory.com</a>.</p>

                <h2>6. HOW WE SECURE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
                <p>SBFE takes all necessary technical and organisational measures to protect the confidentiality,
                    security, and ensure the availability of your Personal Data collected via our digital media. These
                    efforts include but are not necessarily limited to:</p>

                <p>i. Technical measures: We have controls in place to maintain the security of our information and
                    information systems. Files containing Personal Data are protected with different safeguards
                    according to the sensitivity of the relevant information. Appropriate controls (such as restricted
                    access) are placed on our computer systems. Physical access to areas where Personal Data is
                    gathered, processed or stored is also limited to authorised employees.</p>

                <p>ii. Organizational measures: As a condition of employment, our employees are required to follow
                    internal policies and procedures, and all applicable data protection laws and regulations. Access to
                    sensitive Personal Data is limited to those employees who need it to perform their roles.
                    Unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential SBFE entity information by one of our employees is
                    prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures. When you contact one of our employees about your
                    file, you may be asked for some Personal Data. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that
                    only you, or someone authorised by you, has access to your file.</p>

                <p>iii. Contractual measures: All data processors we engage with are subject to an exhaustive selection
                    process and bind to SBFE data protection contractual clauses to ensure the processing of your
                    Personal Data remains within our standards of GDPR compliance. Data processors on behalf of SBFE are
                    also contractually obliged to ensure that any sub-processors engaged in the processing will perform
                    its duties within the same required data protection standards.</p>

                <h2>7. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
                <p>By rule, we will keep your data accurate and up to date for as long as we need it for the purposes
                    described in this Privacy Statement. If the processing of your Personal Data is no longer necessary
                    for any purpose, it will be either irreversibly anonymized (and the anonymized data may be
                    retained), or securely erased.</p>
                <p>Exception to this rule is when it is necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations,
                    resolve disputes and enforce our agreements imposing that SBFE must keep your Personal Data for a
                    longer period after the purpose of the processing was attained.</p>
                <p>For more information on how long we keep cookies on your electronic device, please refer to our <a
                        href="cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

                <h2>8. YOUR RIGHTS IN REGARDS TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND HOW YOU CAN EXERCISE THEM</h2>
                <p>I) In all cases described in apt.4 in which we collect, use or store your Personal Data, you may have
                    the following rights, and, in most cases, you can exercise them free of charge. These rights
                    include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Right of access: the right to request the confirmation on whether your Personal Data is being
                        processed by us or not, and to access that Personal Data;</li>
                    <li>Right to withdraw: when the processing of your Personal Data is legally based on your consent,
                        you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without prejudice to the validity of
                        the processing prior to the withdrawal. Please note, however, that we may still be entitled to
                        process your Personal Data if we have a legitimate reason for doing so. For example, we may
                        retain Personal Data if we need to comply with a legal obligation.<br><br>
                        To withdraw your consent, please go to the ‘Manage Cookies’ section of our Cookie Policy in this
                        website, and remove the consent you provided for the different type of cookies.
                        You always have the option not to share any of your Personal Data with us. If you choose this
                        option, you may be limited in the activities and features we can provide to you.</li>
                    <li>Right to rectification: the right to request the rectification of your Personal Data if it is
                        inaccurate, outdated or incomplete.</li>
                    <li>Right to erasure: the right to request that we erase your Personal Data if: (i) your Personal
                        Data is no longer necessary for the purpose of the data processing, (ii) you have withdrawn your
                        consent on the data processing based exclusively on such consent, (iii) you objected to the data
                        processing, (iv) the Personal Data processing is unlawful, (v) the Personal Data must be erased
                        to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation applicable to SBFE<br><br>
                        Please note that there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your Personal Data, but we
                        are legally obliged or entitled to retain it;</li>
                    <li>Right to object: the right to object to our processing of your Personal Data at any time,
                        including for marketing purposes based on profiling, if the data processing is based on our
                        legitimate interest, the legitimate interest of any other SBFE’s affiliates or an SBFE’s
                        third-party, unless SBFE can demonstrate overriding compelling legitimate grounds for it.</li>
                    <li>Right to restrict: the right to temporarily restrict the processing of your Personal Data
                        carried out by SBFE and any of its affiliates: (i) in the event the accuracy of your
                        Personal Data is contested to allow SBFE to check such accuracy, (ii) if you wish to
                        restrict your Personal Data rather than deleting it despite the fact that the processing
                        is unlawful, (iii) if you wish SBFE to keep your Personal Data because you need it for
                        your defence in the context of legal claims (iv) if you have objected to the processing
                        but SBFE conducts verification to check whether it has legitimate grounds for such
                        processing which may override your own rights.</li>
                    <li>Right to data portability: in some circumstances, the right to receive some Personal
                        Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or request
                        that we transmit those data to a third party where this is technically feasible. Please
                        note that this right only applies to Personal Data which you have provided directly to
                        us or any other SBFE affiliate. Or process to perform a contract or enter into a contract
                        with you</li>
                    <li>Right not to be subject to automated decision making: you can exercise this right
                        when your Personal Data is subject to a decision based solely on automated decision
                        making (including profiling) that can significantly affect you.
                        You have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated
                        processing, and which produces legal or other significant effects on you. In particular,
                        you have the right to:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 30px; margin-top: 10px;">
                            <li>obtain human intervention;</li>
                            <li>express your point of view;</li>
                            <li>obtain an explanation of the decision reached after an assessment; and</li>
                            <li>challenge such a decision.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    infringement of the GDPR, you can lodge a complaint with the relevant Supervisory
                    Authority in your EU country as listed in point 9 below, or the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens
