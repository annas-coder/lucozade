                <h2>INFORMATION ABOUT US</h2>
                <p>Our website is operated by Lucozade Ribena Suntory Limited (“LRSL”). LRSL is registered in England
                    and Wales under company number 8603549 and has its registered office at 2 Longwalk Road, Stockley

                <h2>ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE</h2>
                <p>Access to our website is permitted on a temporary basis, and LRSL reserves the right to withdraw or
                    amend the service provided on our website without notice (see below). LRSL will not be liable if for
                    any reason our website is unavailable at any time or for any period.</p>

                    code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our opinion you have
                    failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms of use or for any other reason. You are
                    responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to our website. You are

                <p>By posting or uploading materials in breach of these terms of use, you might commit a criminal

                <p>LRSL will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack,

                <h2>LINKING TO OUR WEBSITE</h2>
                <p>You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage
                    our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to
                    suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our part except with our prior written
                    approval. You must not establish a link to our website from any website that is not owned by you.
                    Our website must not be framed on any other website, nor may you create a link to any part of our
                    website other than the home page. LRSL reserves the right to withdraw linking permission without
                    notice. The website from which you are linking must comply in all respects with our terms of use. If
                    you wish to make any use of material on our website other than that set out above, please contact
                    us: <a href="http://lucozade.com/support">lucozade.com/support</a></p>

                <h2>LINKS FROM OUR WEBSITE</h2>
                <p>Where our website contains links to other websites and resources provided by third parties, these
                    links are provided for your information only. We have no control over the contents of those websites
                    or resources, and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from
                    your use of them.</p>

                <h2>ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT</h2>
                <p>Many Internet users with disabilities find web sites difficult or even impossible to use simply
                    because of the way they are designed. We are working hard to provide access to information that is
                    available to all our consumers, and this goes for the website, too. We are aware of the types of
                    adaptive technology used by people with disabilities and are redesigning pages across our portfolio
                    of websites to ensure compatibility with as many of these systems as possible. Changes include
                    keeping text clear, formatting layouts and tables, and making sure links adequately describe where
                    they go (‘click here’ does not mean much in isolation).</p>

                <h2>JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW</h2>
                <p>The English courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim arising from, or related to, a
                    visit to our website, although we retain the right to bring proceedings against you for breach of
                    these terms of use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. These terms of use
                    and all disputes under or in relation to them or your use of our website are governed by English
                    law.</p>

                <h2>VARIATIONS</h2>
                <p>LRSL may revise these terms of use at any time by amending this page. You are expected to check this
                    page from time to time to take notice of any changes we made, as they are binding on you. Some of
                    the
                    provisions contained in these terms of use may also be superseded by provisions or notices published
                    elsewhere on our website.</p>
